# Abstract

This is a brief explanation of Confucian philosophy and its core principles by me.
That is, this is my understanding and interpretation of Confucianism.
My understandings are largely based on the interpretation of Confucianism Professor Fu Pei-Rong (傅佩榮)

# Background

Confucianism is a philosophical and ethical system based on the teachings of Confucius (孔子),
a Chinese philosopher who lived from 551 to 479 BC.
Confucianism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture and society for over two millennia,
and its principles continue to be relevant in modern times.
However, throughout history, Confucianism has been interpreted and adapted in various ways,
leading to different schools of thought within the tradition.
During the Song Dynasty (宋朝, 960 to 1279 AD), several Neo-Confucian scholars emerged,
seeking to to reinterpret Confucian teachings in response to the challenges posed by Buddhism and Daoism (道家).
Most notably, the interpretations of scholar Zhu Xi (朱熹, 1130 AD -- 1200 AD) significantly shaped the development of Confucianism,
and has become the dominant form of Confucianism taught and learned in East Asia until this day.

There are several problems with interpretations of Confucianism that have been prevalent throughout history.
One major issue is the rigid and dogmatic approach taken by some scholars,
which has led to a narrow understanding of Confucian principles and their application in society.
This has resulted in a lack of flexibility and adaptability in Confucian teachings,
making it difficult to address contemporary issues and challenges.
Another problem is the tendency to prioritize ritual and tradition over ethical principles,
