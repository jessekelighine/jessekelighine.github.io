<p>This is a brief explanation of Confucian philosophy and its core
principles by me. That is, this is my understanding and interpretation
of Confucianism. My understandings are largely based on the
interpretation of Confucianism Professor Fu Pei-Rong (傅佩榮)</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="background"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Background</h1>
<p>Confucianism is a philosophical and ethical system based on the
teachings of Confucius (孔子), a Chinese philosopher who lived from 551
to 479 BC. Confucianism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture
and society for over two millennia, and its principles continue to be
relevant in modern times. However, throughout history, Confucianism has
been interpreted and adapted in various ways, leading to different
schools of thought within the tradition. During the Song Dynasty (宋朝,
960 to 1279 AD), several Neo-Confucian scholars emerged, seeking to to
reinterpret Confucian teachings in response to the challenges posed by
Buddhism and Daoism (道家). Most notably, the interpretations of scholar
Zhu Xi (朱熹, 1130 AD – 1200 AD) significantly shaped the development of
Confucianism, and has become the dominant form of Confucianism taught
and learned in East Asia until this day.</p>
<p>There are several problems with interpretations of Confucianism that
have been prevalent throughout history. One major issue is the rigid and
dogmatic approach taken by some scholars, which has led to a narrow
understanding of Confucian principles and their application in society.
This has resulted in a lack of flexibility and adaptability in Confucian
teachings, making it difficult to address contemporary issues and
challenges. Another problem is the tendency to prioritize ritual and
tradition over ethical principles,</p>
