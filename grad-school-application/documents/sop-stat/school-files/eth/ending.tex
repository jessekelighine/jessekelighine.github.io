In the future, I aspire to become a statistician.
As my interest shifted from economics to statistics,
I wish to pursue more in to the field of statistics both in theory and practice.
ETH Z\"urich provides an excellent statistics programme that covers a vast array of topics
that I had not had the opportunity to delve into in depth.
I believe that my solid foundation in mathematics and a strong focus on econometrics/statistics and related computational methods
are well-suited for MSc in Statistics at ETH Z\"urich.
